we have two database entity contacts and groups,

contacts has following 
- contact_id (contact id is unique so we set it as Primary Key)
- name 
- company
- phone_number
- gender
- email

groups has following
- group_id (is unique so we set it as primary key)
- grop_name

a contact can join to many groups, and a group can has many contacts
so this relation called Many to Many

to be able handle many to many relationship, we need a junction database
named as "contacts_groups"
