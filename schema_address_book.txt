This schema has relation many to many.

First I make table for contact, it has :
-Id (I set this to primary key because it's unique elemen)
-name
-company name
-phone number
-email

And then I make table for group and it has :
-group Id (I set this to primary key because it's unique elemen)
-group name

Last for handle this relation I make table Contact groups that has:
-Contact id from table contact
-Group id from table group
